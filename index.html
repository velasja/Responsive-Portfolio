				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img src="assets/images/jjheadshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="JJ Velasquez">

				<p>Print journalist attempting a Pokemon-like evolution to web developer. I've worked in newspapers for about 7 years now--covering everything from drug crimes and court trials to rodeos and livestock shows. I currently ply my trade as an editor at <i>Community Impact Newspaper</i>.</p>

				<p>Back to the evolution bit. I'm definitely not the first person to say this: News organizations are not keeping pace with people's changing media consumption habits. Too often we have seen media organizations try to replicate their print design or repurpose their print content online. More often than not, this strategy has failed. I want to be part of the emerging network of journalists using technology to its full capacity---creating new storytelling techniques, and presenting information in innovative and engaging ways.</p>

				<p>But first I have to survive the beast that is learning to code.</p>
